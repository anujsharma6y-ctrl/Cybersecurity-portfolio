🛡️ Sentinel-Security-Suite: Advanced Security & IR Framework
A comprehensive, centralized command-center designed for Security Engineers and DevOps professionals. This suite automates complex tasks across network auditing, cloud compliance, threat detection, and automated incident response using Python.

🚀 Projects Overview:
1. Automated Security Report Generator
Description: An executive reporting engine that bridges the gap between technical data and management insights.

Key Features: Automatically aggregates audit findings into professional PDF reports and dispatches them via secure SMTP.

2. Cloud-Sentinel-Alpha-Suite
Description: A proactive cloud security posture management (CSPM) tool.

Key Features: Scans cloud environments for misconfigurations, public S3 buckets, and identity risks.

3. Core Cybersecurity Monitoring Suite
Description: The foundational layer for continuous system telemetry.

Key Features: Monitors essential system health metrics and alerts on baseline deviations.

4. Real-Time Security Monitor Dashboard & Kill Switch
Description: A live visual command center for immediate threat visibility and containment.

Key Features: A Streamlit-based dashboard featuring a "Nuclear Option" Kill Switch to isolate networks and terminate malicious processes instantly.

5. SOC Automation & Threat Detection Suite
Description: A collection of tools designed to streamline Security Operations Center (SOC) workflows.

Key Features: Automates log analysis, signature-based intrusion detection, and alert triage.

6. Sentinel-SecOps-Suite Installer
Description: An automated deployment script (setup.sh) for the entire ecosystem.

Key Features: Handles environment configuration, dependency installation, and directory permission management in one click.

7. SentinelCloud: Advanced Security & Compliance
Description: Enterprise-grade cloud auditing aligned with global security standards.

Key Features: Maps cloud vulnerabilities to the MITRE ATT&CK framework and checks for MFA/IAM compliance.

8. Service & Permission Security Suite
Description: A system hardening utility focused on the principle of least privilege.

Key Features: Audits system services and file permissions to identify and mitigate privilege escalation paths.

9. Small Business Security Toolkit
Description: A lightweight utility belt for non-enterprise environments.

Key Features: Includes a phishing URL detector, password entropy analyzer, and USB malware scanner.

10. Ultimate CloudDevSecOps Pro Suite
Description: Integrates security directly into the CI/CD pipeline and cloud infrastructure.

Key Features: Automated security gates for cloud deployments and infrastructure-as-code (IaC) scanning.

11. Vigilance Threat Intelligence & Automation Suite
Description: An OSINT and threat-feed integration engine.

Key Features: Scans for credential leaks and automates incident response playbooks based on real-time threat intelligence.
